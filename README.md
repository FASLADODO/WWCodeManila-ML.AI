# Welcome to the Machine Learning and AI Study Group!
We'll be studying how to use machine learning tools to analyze, cluster, classify, and predict data.

If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate on our [discussion
board](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/messages/boards/forum/25085644). 

## Study Group Setup
* Resources such as notes, exercises and samples will be uploaded here.
* Our 1.5-2 hours will be divided into:
    - Introduction/Getting to know first-timers 
    - Discuss questions/issues raised on discussion board 
    - Lightning Talk (anyone who wants to discuss a machine learning project) 
    - Self-paced or mini study session
    - Today I Learned (TIL)
    - Announcement
* Note: Every other session, we will discuss one machine learning/ AI algorithm.
* Check out [these useful cheatsheets](https://gitlab.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-ML.AI/tree/master/cheatsheets)! 

## Sharing Your Work
* After finishing an exercise or assignment, upload your work to our repository.
* [Guide on how to open an issue in a repository](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-Python/blob/master/exercise_upload_step.md)
    * Create a Github account and create a repository for wwcode-python. You will upload your works there.
    * Please upload or push the file in your GIT repository.
    * Open an issue in our repository named 'Your name' - 'topic'. For example, John Doe - First ML Project.
    * Share the link of your work on the issue.
