# Welcome to the Machine Learning and AI Study Group!
We'll be studying how to use machine learning tools to analyze, cluster, classify, and predict data.

If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate on our [discussion
board](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/messages/boards/forum/25085644). 

## Study Group Setup
* Resources such as notes, exercises and samples will be uploaded here.
* Our 1.5-2 hours will be divided randomly into:
    - Introduction/Getting to know first-timers 
    - Discuss questions/issues raised on discussion board 
    - Lightning Talk (anyone who wants to discuss a machine learning project) 
    - Self-paced or mini study session
    - Today I Learned (TIL)
    - Announcement

* Tip: Our exercises in this study group would be great for building portfolios :D
