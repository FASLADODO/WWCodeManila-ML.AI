# Welcome to the Machine Learning and AI Study Group!
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.

## Study Group Setup
* Resources such as notes, exercises and samples will be uploaded here.
* Our 1.5-2 hours will be divided into:
    - Introduction/Getting to know first-timers 
    - Discuss questions/issues raised on discussion board 
    - Lightning Talk (anyone who wants to discuss a machine learning project) 
    - Self-paced or mini study session
    - Today I Learned (TIL)
    - Announcement
* Note: Every other session, we will discuss one machine learning/ AI algorithm.
* Check out [these useful cheatsheets](https://gitlab.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-ML.AI/tree/master/cheatsheets)! 
* If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate in our [Official ML/AI Gitter](https://gitter.im/WWCodeManila/Machine-Learning-AI).
