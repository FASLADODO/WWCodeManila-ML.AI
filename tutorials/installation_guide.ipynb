    "## Installing Anaconda\n",
    "First, we need to install Anaconda. You can download the [installer here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Anaconda?\n",
    "Itâ€™s prepackaged with many useful packages and scientific libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc. Using a normal terminal, we would need to install all these libraries one by one. Anaconda makes it a lot easier for us to start coding without the hassle. \n",

    "- Option 1: Run scripts using Jupyter Notebook (recommended)\n",
    "- Option 2: Run scripts using Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Open a command prompt or terminal and type in \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.\n",

    "2. Hit SHIFT + ENTER to run your Python command.\n",

    "3. You can use the TAB button for auto-completion.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/jupyter5.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "4. The `+` button allows you to add another cell. \n",
    "5. Insert comments/notes in between code by switching the cell type from `Code` to `Markdown` (located in the dropdown). \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "- Default is Command mode (blue border)\n",
    "    - See keyboard shortcuts using h\n",
    "    - Create new cells above (a) or below (b) the current cell\n",
    "    - Navigate using the up arrow and down arrow\n",
    "    - Convert the cell type to Markdown (m) or Code (y)\n",
    "- Switch to Edit mode (green border) using Enter\n",
    "    - Ctrl+Enter to run a cell\n",
    "    - Switch to Command mode using Esc\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Running your first Python script in Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "You can also opt to write Python scripts; then run them in the Anaconda Prompt, which resembles a command prompt or terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a python script `script.py` containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for and open the Anaconda Prompt, `cd` into your directory, and type in:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And voila! If no error occurs, you're good to go. :)"
