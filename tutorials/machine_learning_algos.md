## Tour of Machine Learning Algorithms 

There are a number of machine learning algorithms to choose from. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with some of them.

### List of Resources
---
* [This wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Approaches) describes the different types of algorithms.
* [A Tour of Machine Learning Algorithms](http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/)
	* This is a pretty nice list of machine learning algorithms, with an additional list of resources at the end. I suggest you check this out! :) 
* [The Scikit-Learn website](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) 
	* Also gives valuable insight on the different machine learning algorithms as well as how to apply them in code.
