## Installing Anaconda
First, we need to install Anaconda.

You can download the [installer here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 

### Why Anaconda?
---
Itâ€™s prepackaged with many useful packages and scientific libraries such as:
- Pandas 
- SciPy
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- and a lot more!

Using a normal terminal, we would need to install all these libraries one by one. 
Using Anaconda makes it a lot easier for us to start coding without the hassle. 

### Running you first Python script in Anaconda
---
Create a python script `script.py` containing:

```shell
print("Hello World!")
```

Search for and open the Anaconda Prompt (it should look like a command prompt or terminal), navigate to you directory, and type in:

``` shell
python script.py
```

And voila! If no error occurs, you're good to go. :)
