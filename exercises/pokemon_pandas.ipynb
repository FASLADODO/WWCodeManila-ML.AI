    "### What is pandas?\n",
    "In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term \"<b>pan</b>el <b>da</b>ta\", an econometrics term for multidimensional, structured data sets.\n",

    "#### About the Dataset: \n",
    "This data set includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data as described by Myles O'Neill is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>#</b>: ID for each pokemon\n",
    "- <b>Name</b>: Name of each pokemon\n",
    "- <b>Type 1</b>: Primary type; each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks\n",
    "- <b>Type 2</b>: Secondary type; some pokemon are dual type and have 2\n",
    "- <b>Total</b>: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is\n",
    "- <b>HP</b>: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting\n",
    "- <b>Attack</b>: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)\n",
    "- <b>Defense</b>: the base damage resistance against normal attacks\n",
    "- <b>SP Atk</b>: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\n",
    "- <b>SP Def</b>: the base damage resistance against special attacks\n",
    "- <b>Speed</b>: determines which pokemon attacks first each round\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this table has been acquired from several different sites, including:\n",
    "    - pokemon.com\n",
    "    - pokemondb\n",
    "    - bulbapeida\n",

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "1. Download: [Pokemon dataset](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-ML.AI/blob/master/datasets/pokemon.csv)\n",
    "2. Import the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`)\n",
    "3. Load the dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "### Warmup\n",
    "Note: Most commands for this section can be found in our [first machine learning project](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-ML.AI/blob/master/tutorials/Intro-to-Machine-Learning.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many pokemon are there in the dataset?\n",
    "2. What are the columns in the dataset? \n",
    "3. What are the datatypes of each column?\n",
    "4. What are the first 5 pokemon in the dataset?\n",
    "5. What are the last 5 pokemon in the dataset?\n",
    "6. Print a summary of the data (count, mean, min, max, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning the Data\n",
    "1. Right now, the dataset is indexed by numbers 0 - 800. You can confirm this by printing `df.index`. Suppose we want to index the pokemon by 'Name' instead of by number. Set the index to become the 'Name' column. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html)\n",
    "2. Drop the '#' column and inspect your dataset for changes. [Hint1](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) [Hint2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22149584/what-does-axis-in-pandas-mean)\n",
    "3. - Option 1: Remove all spaces in the column names (e.g. 'Type 1' becomes 'Type1'); \n",
    "   - Option 2: Replace all spaces in the column names with underscores (e.g. 'Type 1' becomes 'Type_1'). [Hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30763351/removing-space-in-dataframe-python)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Selection\n",
    "1. Retrieve the row data of the first pokemon in the dataset by <b>integer-location</b> based indexing. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html)\n",
    "2. Retrieve the row data of the first pokemon in the dataset by <b>label-location</b> based indexing. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html) \n",
    "3. Retrieve the row data of the <b>20th</b> pokemon in the dataset by <b>integer-location</b> based indexing. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html)\n",

    "Suppose Professor Oak allows you to choose from 5 Pokemon from his entire collection to be in your starter team. However, he has the following restrictions:\n",
    "- Your first pokemon must be one of the 1st generation starter pokemon: <b>Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, Pikachu, Eevee</b>\n",
