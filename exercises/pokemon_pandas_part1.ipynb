    "In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term \"<b>pan</b>el <b>da</b>ta\", an econometrics term for multidimensional, structured data sets. (Source: wikipedia)"

These are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go). \n",

    "- <b>Name</b>: Name of each pokemon\n",
    "- <b>Type 1</b>: Primary type; each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks\n",
    "- <b>Type 2</b>: Secondary type; some pokemon are dual type and have 2\n",
    "- <b>Total</b>: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is\n",
    "- <b>HP</b>: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting\n",
    "- <b>Attack</b>: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)\n",
    "- <b>Defense</b>: the base damage resistance against normal attacks\n",
    "- <b>SP Atk</b>: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\n",
