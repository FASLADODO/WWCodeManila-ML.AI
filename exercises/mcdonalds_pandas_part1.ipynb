    "In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term \"<b>pan</b>el <b>da</b>ta\", an econometrics term for multidimensional, structured data sets. (Source: wikipedia)"

    "    - %DVs are based on a 2,000-calorie diet for healthy adults.\n",
    "    - %DVs also tell you whether a food is high or low in a specific nutrient:\n",

    "    - Fat intake is important to monitor. It affects your overall health and heart disease risk. Total fat intake should be 30% of your total daily calories.   So, if you consume 2000 calories each day, no more than 600 calories should come from fat.   That is where the “calories from fat” on food labels can come in handy.
