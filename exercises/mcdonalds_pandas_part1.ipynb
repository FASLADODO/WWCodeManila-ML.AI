    "In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term \"<b>pan</b>el <b>da</b>ta\", an econometrics term for multidimensional, structured data sets.\n",

    "- <b>Percent (%) Daily Value (DV)</b> on the Nutrition Facts label is a guide to the nutrients in one serving of food. \n",
    "    - If the label lists <i>15 percent for calcium</i>, it means that one serving provides <i>15 percent of the calcium you need each day</i>.\n",
    "    - DVs are based on a <b>2,000-calorie diet for healthy adults</b>.\n",
    "    - DVs also tell you whether a food is high or low in a specific nutrient:\n",
    "        - 5 percent or less of a nutrient is low.\n",
    "        - 20 percent or more of a nutrient is high.\n",
    "    - <b>Note</b>: The FDA hasn't set a DV for trans fat because experts recommend that Americans <b>avoid foods with trans fat</b>.\n",
    "    - It is highly recommended that you get in the habit of checking DVs to choose foods \n",

    "    - <b>Calories from fat</b> stands for just the calories you’re receiving from fat.\n",
    "    - Fat intake is important to monitor. It affects your overall health and heart disease risk. Total fat intake should be 30% of your total daily calories.   So, if you consume 2000 calories each day, no more than 600 calories should come from fat.   That is where the “calories from fat” on food labels can come in handy.
