    "Before jumping into the code, it's important to gain a fundamental understanding of basic data collection, preparation, transformation, and visualization. The online book [Data + Design: A simple introduction to preparing and visualizing information](https://infoactive.co/data-design/titlepage01.html) is extremely valuable in giving an overview of the practice. \n",

    "<b>Your task</b>: Read through each chapter of the online book [Data + Design](https://infoactive.co/data-design/titlepage01.html) and take note of the important points. The goal of this exercise is to help you gain, organize, and retain new information through note-taking. \n",
