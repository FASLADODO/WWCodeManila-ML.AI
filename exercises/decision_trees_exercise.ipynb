    "Your task is to build decision tree models for Dataset1 and Dataset2\n",
    "    1. Using entropy as the impurity metric\n",
    "    2. Using gini index as the impurity metric\n",
    "Answer the given questions, then upload your solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise Options: </b>\n",
    "1. Solve by hand / calculator (this might take a lot of time!)\n",
    "2. Use python to write functions that compute the entropy, gini index, and information gain.\n",
    "3. (Advanced) Write a program that builds a decision tree!\n",
    "    - Requires some knowledge on recursion, abstract data types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission</b>\n",
    "1. Draw your decision tree using any graphics app (e.g. MS Paint) or by taking photo (if drawn on paper).   \n",
    "   Include your solution and/or Python code. \n",
    "2. Save your files as a zip file with file name: `[Your Name] - DecisionTree`\n",
    "3. Send your e-mail via gitter: https://gitter.im/WWCodeManila/Machine-Learning-AI (so I can give you write access to our submissions folder)\n",
    "4. Upload the files to the following Dropbox submission folder:https://tinyurl.com/yarmxkbl\n",
