In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term \"<b>pan</b>el <b>da</b>ta\", an econometrics term for multidimensional, structured data sets. (Source: wikipedia)"
