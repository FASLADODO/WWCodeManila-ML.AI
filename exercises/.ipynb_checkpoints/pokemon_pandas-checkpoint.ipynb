    "### What is pandas?\n",
    "pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Today, we'll be exploring a Pokemon Dataset! \n",
    "![alt text][logo] \n",
    "[logo]: http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/image-w-760-scale/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2016/11/21/landscape-1456483171-pokemon2.jpg?itok=1cVzFcqr\n",

    "#### About the Dataset: \n",
    "This data set includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data as described by Myles O'Neill is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #: ID for each pokemon\n",
    "- <b>Name</b>: Name of each pokemon\n",
    "- <b>Type 1</b>: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks\n",
    "- <b>Type 2</b>: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2\n",
    "- <b>Total</b>: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is\n",
    "- <b>HP</b>: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting\n",
    "- <b>Attack</b>: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)\n",
    "- <b>Defense</b>: the base damage resistance against normal attacks\n",
    "- <b>SP Atk</b>: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\n",
    "- <b>SP Def</b>: the base damage resistance against special attacks\n",
    "- <b>Speed</b>: determines which pokemon attacks first each round\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this table has been acquired from several different sites, including:\n",
    "    - pokemon.com\n",
    "    - pokemondb\n",
    "    - bulbapeida\n",
    "    \n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "1. Download: [Pokemon dataset](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-ML.AI/blob/master/datasets/mnist.csv)\n",
    "2. Import the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`)\n",
    "3. Load the dataset using panda's `read_csv` function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warmup\n",
    "Note: Most commands for this section can be found in our [first machine learning project](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-ML.AI/blob/master/tutorials/Intro-to-Machine-Learning.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many pokemon are there in the dataset?\n",
    "2. What are the columns in the dataset? \n",
    "3. What are the datatypes of each column?\n",
    "4. What are the first 5 pokemon in the dataset?\n",
    "5. What are the last 5 pokemon in the dataset?\n",
    "6. How many Pokemon are Legendary types? How many are not?\n",
    "7. How many Pokemon belong to each Generation?\n",
    "8. How Pokemon belong to each Primary type (e.g. Bug, Dark, Dragon, etc.)? \n",
    "9. How Pokemon belong to each Secondary type (e.g. Bug, Dark, Dragon, etc.)? \n",
    "10. Print a summary of the data (count, mean, min, max, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning the Data\n",
    "7. Right now, the dataset is indexed by numbers 0 - 800. You can confirm this by printing `df.index`. Suppose we want to index the pokemon by 'Name' instead of by number. Set the index to become the 'Name' column. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html)\n",
    "9. - Option 1: Remove all spaces in the column names (e.g. 'Type 1' becomes 'Type1'); \n",
    "   - Option 2: Replace all spaces in the column names with underscores (e.g. 'Type 1' becomes 'Type_1'). [Hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30763351/removing-space-in-dataframe-python)\n",
    "8. Drop the '#' column and inspect your dataset for changes. [Hint1](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) [Hint2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22149584/what-does-axis-in-pandas-mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection\n",
    "9. Retrieve the row data of the first pokemon in the dataset (Bulbasaur) by <b>integer-location</b> based indexing. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html)\n",
    "10. Retrieve the row data of the first pokemon in the dataset (Bulbasaur) by <b>label-location</b> based indexing. [Hint](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html) \n",
    "11. Retrieve the row data of your favorite Pokemon. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b>: Congrats on making it this far! No more hints from this point forth, good luck! \n",
    "#### Selection by Type\n",
    "1. Retrieve the first 5 Pokemon whose Primary type is 'Flying'. \n",
    "2. Retrieve the first 5 Flying Type Pokemon (i.e. either Primary type is Flying or Secondary type is Flying)\n",
    "3. Retrieve the first 5 Fire Type Pokemon (i.e. either Primary type is Flying or Secondary type is Fire)\n",
    "4. Retrieve the first 5 Pokemon that are both Bug type and Flying type. \n",
    "5. Retrieve the first 5 Pokemon that are both Dragon type and Flying type. \n",
    "6. - What are your favorite Pokemon Types? \n",
    "   - Choose one (or two) types, and retrieve all Pokemon that fit that criteria. (e.g. I like Pokemon that are both Psychic and Flying)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection by the Numbers\n",
    "Retrieve the name and statistics of the Pokemon as requested below. (e.g. For number 1, print only the name(s) of the pokemon and their 'Total' value(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Bonus Challenge</b>: If there are more than one Pokemon for each category, (e.g. there might be more than one Pokemon sharing the same highest Total value), print all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strongest Pokemon (i.e. has the highest 'Total' value) \n",
    "2. Pokemon with the highest HP\n",
    "3. Pokemon with the highest Attack\n",
    "4. Pokemon with the highest Defense\n",
    "5. Pokemon with the highest Special Attack\n",
    "6. Pokemon with the highest Special Defense\n",
    "7. Pokemon with the highest Speed \n",
    "8. For items 1-7, get their lowest counterpart.\n",
    "9. Print the top 10 strongest Pokemon in descending order. \n",
    "10. Print the top 10 weakest Pokemon in ascending order. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Congrats on finishing the exercise!</b>"
