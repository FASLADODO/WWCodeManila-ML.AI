    "# Decision Trees Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a decision tree for Dataset1 and Dataset2, answer the given questions, and upload your solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise Options: </b>\n",
    "1. Solve by hand / calculator (this might take a lot of time!)\n",
    "2. Use python to write function(s) that compute the entropy and information gain.\n",
    "    - Make sure to handle log2 0.\n",
    "3. (Advanced) Write a program that builds a decision tree!\n",
    "    - Requires some knowledge on recursion, abstract data types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission</b>\n",
    "1. Draw your decision tree using any graphics app (e.g. MS Paint) or by taking photo (if drawn on paper).   \n",
    "   Include your solution and/or Python code. \n",
    "2. Save your files as [Your Name] - DecisionTree\n",
    "3. Upload the files to the following Dropbox:https://tinyurl.com/yarmxkbl\n",
